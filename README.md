# google-homepage

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

An attempt to recreate the looks - but not the functionality - of the Google homepage.

Centering the logo and the form elements proved the most challenging.

I will need to practice that quite a bit.
